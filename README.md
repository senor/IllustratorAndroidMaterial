IllustratorAndroidMaterial
==========================
Hello!


First of all, big thanks to Taylor Ling
for paving the path with .PSD Android kits.
They have been used as base of this project.

Material elements are used from official Google Design documentation and guidelines
http://www.google.com/design/spec/resources/

This is still work in progress so any suggestions please send with http://goo.gl/TXR1Jz
and I will add them in next release.

Document is created in XHDPI resolution, but that may be subject of change in the future. When using elements from symbol library resize them 2x.

I wish this screen could scroll so I can write some more :) Do contact me for advanced tips.
